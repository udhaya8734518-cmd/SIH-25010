## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution

Our solution aims to address the challenges faced in agriculture and rural development by leveraging technology. The system will provide farmers and rural communities with accessible, efficient, and data-driven tools to improve productivity, reduce waste, and ensure sustainability.

Key aspects of the proposed solution include:

Real-time monitoring of soil, water, and crop health using sensors/IoT.

Mobile/web platform to deliver actionable insights to farmers in local languages.

AI/ML models for yield prediction, pest detection, and smart irrigation suggestions.

Supply chain integration to connect farmers directly with markets, minimizing middlemen.

## Technical Approach

Technologies to be used: IoT devices, sensors, cloud computing, machine learning, Android application/web platform.

Methodology & process:

1. Requirement analysis (understanding farmer challenges).


2. Prototype development (IoT sensor integration + mobile app).


3. Testing with real-time data.


4. Iterative improvements based on feedback.



Implementation tools:

Programming languages (Python, Java/Kotlin for Android, Node.js/React for web).

Databases (MySQL/Firebase).

ML libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch).

IoT boards (Arduino/Raspberry Pi).


## Feasibility and Viability

Feasibility and Viability

Feasibility

Technical Feasibility:

The proposed solution uses readily available technologies such as IoT sensors, mobile applications, and cloud platforms.

Open-source tools and affordable hardware (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, low-cost soil sensors) make the project implementable within limited budgets.

Offline-first mobile app design ensures usability even in rural areas with poor internet.


Operational Feasibility:

Farmers and rural communities can adopt the system with minimal training.

Local language support and voice-based interaction increase accessibility.

The system requires only basic smartphones and inexpensive sensor devices.


Scalability:

The solution can start at the village/block level and scale to district/state level with cloud-based data storage and modular design.



Viability

Economic Viability:

Low-cost sensors and open-source software reduce development and deployment costs.

Farmers save money through optimized irrigation, reduced fertilizer use, and better crop management.

Potential partnerships with government schemes, NGOs, and agri-tech companies can make deployment cost-effective.


Social Viability:

Improves farmer income, reduces crop loss, and empowers rural communities.

Bridges the digital divide by giving rural users access to modern technology.


Long-Term Sustainability:

Data collected can be continuously used for predictive analysis, improving accuracy over time.

The platform can be monetized via minimal subscription fees, government funding, or integration with agri-marketplace.

## Impact and Benefits

Impact

On Farmers: Provides real-time insights on soil health, irrigation, and pest management, leading to higher crop yield and reduced losses.

On Rural Communities: Bridges the technology gap by delivering accessible, affordable digital tools in local languages.

On Economy: Improves supply chain efficiency, reduces dependency on middlemen, and increases farmer income.

On Environment: Promotes sustainable farming by optimizing water use, reducing excessive fertilizer and pesticide application.

On Policy Makers: Offers reliable data for better agricultural planning and decision-making at village/district levels.


Benefits

Higher Productivity: Data-driven decisions boost yield and efficiency.

Cost Savings: Smart irrigation and input management reduce unnecessary expenses.

Accessibility: Mobile + offline-first features make it usable even in remote areas.

Scalability: Can be expanded to multiple regions, crops, and integrated with government schemes.

Sustainability: Long-term adoption ensures better livelihoods and environmental protection.

Research Background

Studies highlight that over 60% of Indian farmers depend on monsoon rains, making irrigation management critical (ICAR report, 2022).

According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), 30–40% of crops are lost annually due to pests and diseases, which can be reduced through early detection.

Research shows that IoT-based soil monitoring can improve water efficiency by up to 25–30%.

Mobile penetration in rural India is increasing, with over 500 million smartphone users, enabling digital agriculture adoption (TRAI, 2023).


Similar Existing Solutions

eNAM (National Agriculture Market): Government platform for market linkage.

Kisan Suvidha App: Provides weather and market information but lacks real-time soil/crop monitoring.

Private Agri-Tech Startups (e.g., DeHaat, Ninjacart): Focus mainly on supply chain, showing demand for farmer-focused digital tools.
